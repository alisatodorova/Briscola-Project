# Briscola-Project

A semester-long group project split into 3 phases. Please consult _2021-2022-2-1_ProjectManual-PlayIt_final.pdf_ for more information about the project and its phases.

Our code for each phase is in a separate folder and inside there's a README file that explains how to run the code.

**Short summary**: We first implemented Human vs. Human version of the Italian card game Briscola in Java with GUI using JavaFX. Then, we created Human vs. AI version using Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial Search, Markov Decision Process, Minimax algorithm and Monte Carlo Tree Search.

For further explanation of what we did, please consult _FinalReport.pdf_.
